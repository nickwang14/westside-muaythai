# Making Friends and Memories while getting fit

_Muay Thai_ (มวยไทย), transliterated to english as 'Thai Boxing', is the art of 8 limbs. A combat sport where you can use Punches, Kicks, Knees, and Elbows to do damage to your opponent.

More recently taken up as a competitive sport, Muay Thai offers a fun way to learn about your body through movement and exercise. From HIIT style exercises, to in depth technical skills, we provide classes to help you develop your physical capabilities and learn about self defence in an interactive and fun way.

We offer classes for all fitness and experience levels, from a competition team to women's only closed sessions.

[Our Trainers](/instructors) have real experience from all around the world with an unrivaled passion for the sport, making sure that you get the most out of every session.

## FAQ

## What equipment do I need in order to train?

All you need to bring is comfortable shorts or any athletic wear you feel comfortable sweating (a lot) in, and a water bottle.

However, if you're experienced in Muaythai, we highly recommend you wear muaythai shorts, a pair of gloves, handwraps, as well as mouthguard and shinguards if you plan on/have been invited to _spar_.

#### We also sell team branded gear at the gym

However, stock is limited and subject to our ordering process, here are some other recommended options:

## Do I need any experience to join?

Not at all, our classes are set up so you can hop in and start working out right away. We have some classes that require a level of fitness and experience, those can be found on [Our Schedule](https://westsidemuaythai.com/schedule)

## Do I need to be in shape to do muaythai?

That depends on your goals, for all intents and purposes, the answer is no. Come in, have fun hitting stuff, and watch yourself get in shape while you learn a new skill!

If you're looking to compete, know that being in shape is a baseline requirement. Practicing muaythai is quite safe, but competeting can be quite dangerous if you're not ready to defend yourself.

## Are there any age restrictions to practice muaythai?

Currently, we don't offer a good setup for children, so we recommend a minimum age of 14 years old. We do not have a maximum age limit, but we do require you to sign a safety waiver. Please let your instructor know if you have any health concerns regardless of your age!

## Can I compete? How long does it take?

We love it when members want to take the dive into competition! Ask your instructor about timelines and advanced classes for competition.

You can definitely compete with Westside Muaythai, but note that you're representing our team, so it's up to the coaches' discretions if you're ready skill-wise and preparation-wise for a fight.

Typically, we recommend that at least 6-8 months of training 3-5 days a week (at a minimum) before competing if you have no martial arts experience. Remember that combat sports can be dangerous, so we set these timelines for you safety as well as in respect for the active competitors who put that time and effort in at the gym.

## Vince Veys Germann
   >I started training Muay Thai in January of 2011. I was trying to work out in the Highschool weight room, where I saw two guys from my bus play-sparring together. I asked them about it and they invited me to the gym to try it out. I guess you could say it was love at first fight ðŸ˜‰

   >I was very overweight at the time, but formed a disciplined lifestyle through the sport. In addition to setting goals and competing, Muay Thai helped me lose 120 lbs. This lifestyle and transformative experience translated nicely to a career in facilitating others on a similar path. For me, maintaining that lifestyle and entering the ring to fight is the certificate of legitimacy in the industry.
